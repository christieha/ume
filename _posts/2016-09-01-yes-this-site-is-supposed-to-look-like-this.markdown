As humans, as companies, we're all works in progress.

As three women whoâ€™ve worked our asses off in NYC, with 35+ collective years of experience, weâ€™ve realized we needed to do something that contributes to the world. So, after 8 years as Black Paper Design, we took what we do best (design and strategy) and folded it into the heart of UME 1.0 (social impact) to launch the new UME.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, weâ€™re UME. Weâ€™re a design firm that is conscious and purpose-driven. Our first client? Us.

Like you, we've got lots of dreams. But, the hardest part is prioritization and making time to work on them. So, we're setting deadlines, committing time for practice and making our brand development process public to keep us accountable and to honor our evolution.

Here's the deal. Every Friday, weâ€™ll make small adjustments to this site. The goal is to have the website done by the end of October 2016. Yes, the site will look wonky most of the time. But hey, Rome wasn't built in a day. We'll also share what goes on behind the scenes as we develop the UME brand. Are we freaked out by this experiment? Totally. It will be messy, probably TMI, but freeing (we think). We can't wait to see how UME turns out.

See you next Friday!
